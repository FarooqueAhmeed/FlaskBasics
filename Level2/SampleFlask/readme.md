# Sample Flask

## Getting Started Locally  
1. Create schema (named sampleFlaskApp) in your database server by using workbench (Name DB as you wish and change in connection string accordingly)
2. Change connection string in settings.py
3. SQLAlchemy is used so database will be created from Model classes.
4. Open Terminal in pycharm
5. Navigate to SampleApp directory by using DOS commands (CD SampleFlask)
6. Issue following command
7. 
```shell script
D:\Py Projects\FlaskBasics\Level2\SampleFlask> python db.py
```
This will reset and re-create database for you. All the data in DB if any will be truncated.
8. Run app.py
###This is partial work, The main take away in this project is how it creates database from models.
